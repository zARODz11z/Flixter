### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- My emulator at one point would just not run, it was frustrating but I figurered it out.
- Figuring out how to overlay the play image took a little bit of research
- determing which movies are popular was confusing at first but very straight forward

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
I struggled with making the Scooby Doo poster the same size as the rest of the posters, for some reason it is smaller than the others.
